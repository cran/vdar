Description: The qda() function from package 'MASS' is extended to calculate a weighted linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by changing the group variances and group means based on cell-wise uncertainties.
    The uncertainties can be derived e.g. through relative errors for each individual measurement (cell), not only row-wise or column-wise uncertainties.
    The method can be applied compositional data (e.g. portions of substances, concentrations) and non-compositional data.
